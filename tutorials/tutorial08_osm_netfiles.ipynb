    "# Tutorial 08: Networks from OpenStreetMap and Custom Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we discuss how networks that have been imported from OpenStreetMap or simulator specific network files for both SUMO and Aimsun can be integrated and run in Flow. This will all be presented via the Bay Bridge network, seen in the figure below. The following tutorial is organized as follows. In section 1, we demonstrated how osm files can be simulated in Flow and describe methods for customizing the scenario class. In section 2, we present how custom sumo network templates, i.e. the generated .net.xml files, can be modified and simulated in Flow for the purposed of improving network features. Finally, in section 3, we demonstrate how custom Aimsun network files can be simulated in Flow.\n",

    "Networks from OpenStreetMap are commonly used in many traffic simulators when trying to replicate traffic in realistic traffic geometries. This is true for Aimsun and Sumo as well, with each supporting several techniques for importing such network files. This process is further simplified and abstracted in Flow, with users simply required to specify the path to the osm file in order to simulate traffic in the network.\n",
